# Generative Crystals

This is the result of me working through Matthew Eplerâ€™s YouTube series [Designing Generative Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTqvf0BkTNE&list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0). You can find his code [here](https://github.com/matthewepler/Generative-Design-Systems-with-P5js) and some of the details of what I changed and learned [here](https://stephanmax.is/writing/2018-07-16-implementing-a-generative-design-system).

## Build

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then go to the `build` folder and open `index.html` in your favorite browser (yep, just a plain HTML and JavaScript fileâ€”no dev server needed ðŸ˜‰).

If you need a minified version run

```shell
$ npm run build
```

## Model

The model is a DCGAN trained with tricolor crystals. 

- Machine used for training: NVIDIA Tesla V100 with 1 GPU in Google Cloud
